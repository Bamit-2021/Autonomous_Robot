Objective: 

Develop a simulation in Python for an autonomous robot navigating a 
rectangular warehouse measuring 10 meters by 10 meters. The robot should move 
from the starting point at (0, 0) to the destination at (7, 9). 

Constraints: 

1. The warehouse dimensions are 10 meters by 10 meters. 
2. The robot can only travel at a speed of 0.1 m/s. 
3. After traveling for 0.1 seconds, the robot must stop for 2 seconds. 
4. The robot must avoid any obstacles (if applicable). 
5. The robot's movement must be within the boundaries of the warehouse.

1. Define the Simulation Environment and Robot Properties
The robot must start at (0, 0) and navigate to (7, 9), moving at a speed of 0.1 m/s with a stopping requirement every 0.1 seconds. Weâ€™ll use Python and libraries like matplotlib for visualization and time for controlling pauses.

2. Install Required Libraries
matplotlib
seaborn
numpy
pandas
pyplot

3. Code Structure for the Simulation

Here's a breakdown of the code into different parts for clarity:

Step 1: Define the Warehouse and Robot Constraints

Step 2: Define the Robot Class and Movement Logic

Step 3: Set Up the Simulation Environment

Step 4: Execute the Simulation

4. Run and Observe the Simulation
